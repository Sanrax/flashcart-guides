# iTouchDS
## M3-Adapter Team

!!! info

    These carts are made by the same team as the M3 DS Real cart. They advertised RTS support in their stock kernel, similar to the M3's RTS support in its Sakura kernel. As the cart is M3 hardware at the end of the day, it's compatible with M3 YSMenu after being booted with Lifehackerhansol's flashcart-bootstrap. A package containing the bootstrap and YSMenu for this cart is provided in the setup instructions below.

### Setup Guide:

1. Format the SD card you are using by following [this guide.](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)

1. Download the [iTouchDS YSMenu 7.06 package.](https://github.com/Sanrax/YSMenu-Custom-Packages/releases/download/v7.06/iTouchDS_YSMenu_7.06.zip)

1. Next, extract *the contents* of the downloaded kernel zip to your SD card.

1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into the `Games` folder.

1. Insert the SD back into the cart, plug the cart into the DS, and see if it boots into the menu.

!!! tip

    If you'd like to use RTS (Real-Time-Save), you can also use the cart's stock kernel, provided below. Do keep in mind though that game compatibility won't be as good as YSMenu, and the RTS feature itself can be hit-or-miss.
