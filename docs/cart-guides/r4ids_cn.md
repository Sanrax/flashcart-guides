### Setup Guide:

1. Format the SD card you are using by following [this guide.](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)

1. Download the [R4iDS WoodR4 1.64 kernel.](https://flashcard-archive.ds-homebrew.com/r4ids.cn/r4ids.cn_Wood_R4_1.64.zip)

1. Open/extract the zip file, and copy *the contents* into the root of your SD card.

1. If you'd like to be able to use cheats on your games, download a [cheat database.](https://github.com/DeadSkullzJr/NDS-i-Cheat-Databases/releases/latest)

1. You will need the `usrcheat.7z` file. Extract it using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), inside you will find a `usrcheat.dat` file. Copy this file to `__rpg/cheats/` on your SD card. (Create the `cheats` folder if it doesn't exist)

1. Create a `Games` folder in your SD card root, and place your `.nds` game ROMs inside. You can also create additional folders to help with organizing/categorizing your ROMs.

1. Insert the SD card back into your cart, plug the cart into your DS, and see if it boots into the menu.

!!! tip

    If you are unable to get any games to load in WoodR4, you may have one of the last-batch carts with faulty DS mode. If that's the case, you'll need to setup [BL2CK](bl2ck.md) instead.
