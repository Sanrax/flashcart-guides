# Original R4iGold.cc
## r4igold.cc

!!! info

    The original r4igold.cc cart is a clone of the Galaxy Eagle. Unfortunately, the Galaxy Eagle itself is a bad clone of the Acekard 2i, and neither AKAIO nor BL2CK work properly on it. While BL2CK boots, it will freeze on a white screen when attempting to load any commercial ROM file. Therefore, AKMenu-Next is the recommended primary kernel for Galaxy Eagle and related carts, so that nds-bootstrap can be used to load games. As an alternative option, the stock kernel is also provided, but it will likely be able to run less games than AKMenu-Next.

### Setup Guide:

=== "AKMenu-Next"

    1. Download the latest release of [AKMenu-Next Flashcart Edition.](https://github.com/coderkei/akmenu-next/releases/latest/download/akmenu-next-flashcart.zip)

    1. Extract the downloaded `akmenu-next-flashcart.zip` file with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

    1. From within the akmenu-next files, copy the following files/folders to your SD card root:

        - `_nds` folder
        - `BOOT.NDS`

    1. Download the latest release of [nds-bootstrap.](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/nds-bootstrap/releases/latest/download/nds-bootstrap.zip)

    1. Extract the downloaded `nds-bootstrap.zip` file with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

    1. Copy the *contents* of the files from the extracted `nds-bootstrap.zip` file to the `_nds` folder on your SD card.

    1. If you'd like to be able to use cheats on your games, download a [cheat database.](https://github.com/DeadSkullzJr/NDS-i-Cheat-Databases/releases/latest)
    
    1. You will need the `usrcheat.7z` file. Extract it using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), inside you will find a `usrcheat.dat` file. Copy this file to `_nds/akmenunext/cheats/` on your SD card. (Create the `cheats` folder if it doesn't exist)

    1. Open the `Autoboot` folder within the AKMenu-Next files.
    
    1. Copy the *contents* of the `Galaxy Eagle` folder (do not copy the folder itself) to the root of your SD card.

    1. Create a `Games` folder in your SD card root, and place your `.nds` game ROMs inside. You can also create additional folders to help with organizing/categorizing your ROMs.
    
    1. The files on your SD card should now look like this:
    
        - ![GEi AKMenu-Next](../images/SD_Files/R4iGold_cc/R4iGold_cc_AKMenu_Next.png){ align=left width="600"}
    
    1. Insert the SD card back into your cart, plug the cart into your DS, and see if it boots into the menu.
