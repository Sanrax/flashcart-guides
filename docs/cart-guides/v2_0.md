!!! info

    These carts are very old demon-hardware DSTTi clones, and have a special quirk - they load part of the cart's firmware from a file on the SD card - `_DS_MENU.DAT`. When the `_DS_MENU.DAT` file is present on the SD, it will behave like a normal demon DSTT clone - checks for an R4.dat to load, and shows `MENU?` if the file isn't found. If the SD card is empty however, the cart will load to a white screen.

### Setup Guide:

=== "YSMenu"

    1. Format the SD card you are using by following the [formatting tutorial.](../tutorials/formatting.md){target="_blank"}
    
    1. Download the [r4isdhc.com Brand New V2.0 YSMenu 7.06 package.](https://github.com/Sanrax/YSMenu-Custom-Packages/releases/download/v7.06/r4isdhc.com_Brand-New_V2.0_YSMenu_7.06.zip)
    
    1. Next, extract *the contents* of the downloaded kernel zip to your SD card.
    
    1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into the `Games` folder.
    
    1. The files on your SD card should now look like this:
    
        - ![R4 V2.0](../images/SD_Files/V2.0_Brand_New/V2.0.png){ align=left width="600"}
    
    1. Insert the SD back into the cart, plug the cart into the DS, and see if it boots into the menu.
    
    !!! tip "Themes"
    
        Looking to change the default theme? Check out the YSMenu themes repository at [themes.flashcarts.net](https://themes.flashcarts.net/ysmenu/)!

=== "Pico-Launcher"

    !!! info "Kernel Info"

        Pico-Launcher is the game menu for the DS-Pico (an open source DS flashcart by the LNH team) and other supported carts. Combined with Pico-Loader, it can be used as a full kernel, and supports almost all retail DS games. It features a material-inspired user interface, and an extremely fast loader.

    !!! warning "Cheats and Soft-Reset"

         Note that Pico-Launcher/Loader currently does not support using cheats, and soft-reset to the game menu is also unsupported. If these features are important to you, consider using YSMenu.

    1. Format the SD card you are using by following the [formatting tutorial.](../tutorials/formatting.md){target="_blank"}

    1. Download the latest [Pico Package for DSTT.](https://picoarchive.cdn.blobfrii.com/pico_package_DSTT.zip)

        - `_pico` folder

    1. Create a `Games` folder in your SD card root, and place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play inside.
