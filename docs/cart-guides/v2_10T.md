!!! info

    These carts are very old demon-hardware DSTTi clones, and have a special quirk - they load part of the cart's firmware from a file on the SD card - `_DS_MENU.DAT`. When the `_DS_MENU.DAT` file is present on the SD, it will behave like a normal demon DSTT clone - checks for an R4.dat to load, and shows `MENU?` if the file isn't found. If the SD card is empty however, the cart will load to a white screen.

### Setup Guide:

=== "Pico-Launcher"

    !!! info "Kernel Info"

        Pico-Launcher is the game menu for the DS-Pico (an open source DS flashcart by the LNH team) and other supported carts. Combined with Pico-Loader, it can be used as a full kernel, and supports almost all retail DS games. It features a material-inspired user interface, and an extremely fast loader.

    !!! warning "Cheats and Soft-Reset"

         Note that Pico-Launcher/Loader currently does not support using cheats, and soft-reset to the game menu is also unsupported. If these features are important to you, consider using YSMenu.

    ### Setup Guide:

    1. Format the SD card you are using by following the [formatting tutorial.](../tutorials/formatting.md){target="_blank"}

    1. Download the latest [Pico Package for DSTT.](https://picoarchive.cdn.blobfrii.com/pico_package_DSTT.zip)

    1. Extract the `pico_package_DSTT.zip` file with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), or your native file manager app.

    1. From within the extracted files, copy the following files/folders to your SD card root:

        - `_pico` folder

        - `_picoboot.nds`

        - `r4.dat`

    1. Download the [`_DS_MENU.DAT` file for V2.10T/V2.20T carts](https://archive.flashcarts.net/r4sdhc.com/V2.10T_init_file/_DS_MENU.DAT) and place it on your SD card root.

    1. Create a `Games` folder in your SD card root, and place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play inside.

    1. The files on your SD card should now look like this:
    
         - ![R4i-SDHC](../images/SD_Files/V2.10T/Pico.png){ align=left width="600"}

    1. Insert the SD back into the cart, plug the cart into the DS, and see if it boots into the menu.
