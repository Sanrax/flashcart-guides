!!! info

    These carts are very old demon-hardware DSTTi clones, and have a special quirk - they load part of the cart's firmware from a file on the SD card - `_DS_MENU.DAT`. When the `_DS_MENU.DAT` file is present on the SD, it will behave like a normal demon DSTT clone - checks for an R4.dat to load, and shows `MENU?` if the file isn't found. If the SD card is empty however, the cart will load to a white screen.

### Setup Guide:

1. Format the SD card you are using by following [this guide.](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)

1. Download the [V2.10T/V2.20T YSMenu 7.06 package.](https://github.com/Sanrax/YSMenu-Custom-Packages/releases/download/v7.06/r4sdhc.com.2.10T_2.20T.YSMenu.7.06.zip)

1. Next, extract *the contents* of the downloaded kernel zip to your SD card.

1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into the `Games` folder.

1. Insert the SD back into the cart, plug the cart into the DS, and see if it boots into the menu.
