!!! info

    These carts are very old demon-hardware DSTTi clones, and have a special quirk - they load part of the cart's firmware from a file on the SD card - `_DS_MENU.DAT`. When the `_DS_MENU.DAT` file is present on the SD, it will behave like a normal demon DSTT clone - checks for an R4.dat to load, and shows `MENU?` if the file isn't found. If the SD card is empty however, the cart will load to a white screen.

### Setup Guide:

=== "YSMenu"

    1. Format the SD card you are using by following [this guide.](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)

    1. Download the [V2.10T/V2.20T YSMenu 7.06 package.](https://github.com/Sanrax/YSMenu-Custom-Packages/releases/download/v7.06/r4sdhc.com.2.10T_2.20T.YSMenu.7.06.zip)

    1. Next, extract *the contents* of the downloaded kernel zip to your SD card.

    1. Place any `.nds` game ROMs you'd like to play into the `Games` folder.

    1. Insert the SD back into the cart, plug the cart into the DS, and see if it boots into the menu.

=== "MultiMenuDS"

    !!! info

        MultiMenuDS is a kernel that provides an AKMenu/Wood style frontend while using the TTMenu game loader. It supports Acekard themes & cheats and is also able to make use of nds-bootstrap.

    1. Format the SD card you are using by following [this guide.](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/Formatting_an_SD_card)

    1. Download the [MultiMenu V2.10T/V2.20T Package.](https://github.com/coderkei/MultiMenuDS/releases/latest/download/R42.10T2.20T_MultiMenu.zip)

    1. Open/extract the zip file, and copy *the contents* into the root of your SD card.

    1. If you'd like to be able to use cheats on your games, download a [cheat database.](https://github.com/DeadSkullzJr/NDS-i-Cheat-Databases/releases/latest)

    1. You will need the `usrcheat.7z` file. Extract it using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), inside you will find a `usrcheat.dat` file. Copy this file to `TTMenu/cheats/` on your SD card. (Create the `cheats` folder if it doesn't exist)

    1. Create a `Games` folder in your SD card root, and place your `.nds` game ROMs inside. You can also create additional folders to help with organizing/categorizing your ROMs.

    1. Insert the SD card back into your cart, plug the cart into your DS, and see if it boots into the menu.

    1. (Optional) Download the [nds-bootstrap package](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/nds-bootstrap/releases/latest/download/nds-bootstrap.zip) and extract it. Copy `nds-bootstrap-release.nds` to the `_nds` folder on your SD card.

    !!! tip

        This kernel uses the TTMenu game loader which some ROM Hacks are not compatible with. If you get an error code when loading a ROM Hack, Follow Step 8 above. Afterwards highlight the game and press `Y` and then press `Y` again for Game Settings. Change option under `Use ROM loader` from `default` to `nds-bootstrap`. Press `A` to save.
