!!! info

    MoonShell 2 is a media center for Nintendo DS systems. It supports playing music, watching videos, viewing photos, editing text, and more.

!!! tip "Choosing a Moonshell 2 Version"

    Choose ChildZwai edition if you are running Moonshell on a DSpico. This will allow you to use the DSi DSP for better music playback quality.

    If you are using any other flashcart, choose the stable version, since ChildZwai edition causes issues/choppiness when running in DS mode without a ROMEO2 in slot-2.

!!! tip "Converting Videos For MS2"

    MoonShell 2 plays DPG videos - regular modern file formats like mp4 or mkv are not supported. You can convert your videos into DPG format with [DPG4x](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/DPG4X), or Deletecat's [online DPG converter](https://dpg.deletecat.com/).
